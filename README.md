# Power-BI-Inventory-analysis-DEMAND-SQL-code


This SQL code selects information about planned orders from the database. 
It retrieves order numbers, order lines, items, item groups, dates, and quantities. 
Then it joins this information with the items table based on the 't_plni' primary key. 
Finally, the results are filtered based on a specific location, source type, and order type.
